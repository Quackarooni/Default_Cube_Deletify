# Default Cube Delete-ify

## Installation

Download the .py file from the release page and install via `Edit > Preferences > Addons > Install`. Blender should automatically recognize the script as an add-on.

## Usage

Once installed, the add-on should take care of deleting the default cube *(descriptively named as 'Cube')* from any newly-made blend files.
